# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Based on provided csv files, each containing different information with connecting primary keys, analysis was done by joining different tables together to create a new table with the data that is needed. 

For the first table, number of retiring employees per title was determined and identified by joining the Employees and the Titles tables together on the primary key.

For the second table, the employees who are eligible for the mentorship program were determined and identified by joining the Employees, Department Employees, and Titles tables on the primary key where a certain date range was set in place for the employees' birth dates.
